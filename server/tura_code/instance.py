"""One root per data directory: two servers on one folder would share sessions,
settings and Dhee's store and overwrite each other's writes.

The server holds an exclusive lock on ``<data dir>/server.lock`` for as long as
it runs (the OS drops it when the process dies, so a crash never leaves a stale
lock) and writes who it is into the file, so a second start can say where the
running root is.
