"""Dynamic tool catalogue: a small standing toolset, the rest found on demand.

With ``dynamic_tools`` on, the toolsets in ``DEFERRED_PLUGINS`` are not listed to
the model at start. Two always-listed tools replace them: ``find_tools`` ranks
the deferred tools for a task and returns their schemas, ``use_tool`` runs one.

Discovery is presentation, not permission. Every call, listed or discovered,
passes ``allowed`` (the owner's ``tool_scope``) and then the owning toolset's own
approvals, so finding a tool grants nothing. The tools a session sees never
depend on what the model asks for: ``tool_scope`` is host configuration.

Whether this saves tokens is unmeasured; ``stats`` only counts definition size.
