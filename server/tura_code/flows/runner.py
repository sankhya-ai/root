"""Running a flow's candidates: implement, verify on the host, repair, judge.

Each candidate is a hidden session of the same runtime (``kind="candidate"``)
working in its own Git worktree, unattended: edits and the project's checks
are allowed, anything that would need the owner is refused and the agent
adapts. After each attempt the *host* runs the flow's verification commands
in the worktree; a failure feeds its exact output into the next attempt, up to
:data:`MAX_ATTEMPTS`. Candidates run concurrently.
